= Install instructions =========================================================

There are no formal methods right now to install xfer9860. The only dependency
is the usblib-library. To compile the source code, enter `src/' and run:

	make

And wait a few seconds. You can run the new executable `xfer9860' to view usage
instructions.

	./xfer9860

If this does not work for some reason, you can try the binary located in `bin/'.
