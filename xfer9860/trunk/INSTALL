= Compiling from source ========================================================

All you need to compile the sources is libusb and SCons (requires python). To
compile, run:
  $ scons -Q

The executable is located in `src/', and can be run with:
  $ src/xfer9860
Depending on the distribution, you might have to run xfe9860 as root.

To clean up (everything) after the compilation, run:
  $ scons -c
