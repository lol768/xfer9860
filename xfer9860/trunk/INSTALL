= Compiling from source ========================================================

You need libusb-1.0 and SCons (requires python). To start compilation, run:
  $ scons -Q

The executable is located in `src/', and can be run with:
  $ src/xfer9860

Depending on the distribution, you might have to run xfe9860 as root.
If you want to "install" xfer9860, copy the executable to an appropriate place
like `/usr/bin/'

To clean up after the compilation (including the xfer9860 binary), run:
  $ scons -c
