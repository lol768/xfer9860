= Readme =======================================================================

The goal of xfer9860 is to provide an open source equivalent of FA-124 by Casio.
You can find new releases, our forum, tracker and most other things at:

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/xfer9860

The projects website (also hosted by sf.net) is located at:

	http://xfer9860.sourceforge.net/

Installation/usage instructions for xfer9860 can be found in the INSTALL file.
Note that file download only works reliably on small files, up to a few 100kB.

If you have time, give me feedback at <andreasmarcel@gmail.com> and tell me what
could be better, or what you like!

= History ======================================================================

Time flies, so I decided to take notes on the development and history;

I (Andreas Bertheussen) had just bought an fx-9860G SD for my math exam (1MX,
Norway). The possibilities using FA-124 were quite good, but because I was using
Linux, there were none. Looking around for solutions, I stumbled upon UCF
(www.casiocalc.com), where Manuel Naranjo also seemed to be interested in
finding a way to use the calculator in Linux. Manuel created the
9860transfer project on Google Code (March 07) and we started digging through
USB logs, trying to figure out the protocol. Based on the logs, Manuel wrote a
simple program that 'replayed' what FA-124 did.
There was not much progress until I got my hands on some real documentation
(April). Some of the routines of Manuel's 9860transfer were moved on to a new
project, xfer9860, hosted on sourceforge and maintained by me. The development
of xfer9860 stalled until late June, when some weird bugs were removed, and
v0.1 was released.
