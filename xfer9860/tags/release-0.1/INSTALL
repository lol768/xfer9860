= Install instructions =========================================================

There are no formal methods right now to install xfer9860. The only dependency
is the usblib-library. To compile the source code, run:
	make
And wait a few seconds. You can then run the program using:
	./xfer9860 <sourcefile> <destfile>
Note that destfile has to be a filename of up to 8 characters, AND a 3 character extension.
